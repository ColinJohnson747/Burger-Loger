# Burger-Loger

This application is designed to track the status of burgers through front and back end Javascript, Handlebars, Express, and Mysql. The application will log all inputs from the HTML, utilize different requests, and then send those requests to the server, changing and storing the data.

The application is straight forward to use, with buttons to either delete, eat, or add a burger.

To add a burger enter the name of the burger you would like to add, select whether or not it has been eaten, and then click add. It will be logged to the back end, and then put on the page.
